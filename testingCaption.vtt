Hello, and welcome to the
                video for Module 1.

00:08.400 --> 00:14.960
In this video, my key point is to really talk about
                business systems that support your business objectives.

00:15.040 --> 00:20.920
So, if you think about your business strategy, what we
                want to do in the business case is to assess and

00:20.920 --> 00:27.840
evaluate the degree to which our existing systems,
                the as-is scenario, supports your business objectives.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.200
Now, obviously, your context for that assessment
                is: What are your business objectives?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.480
Where is your business now?

00:34.840 --> 00:35.640
Where is it heading?

00:35.680 --> 00:36.640
Where do you want it to go?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.040
That vision, the long-term
                picture for the future.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.280
And what's the gap?

00:40.520 --> 00:43.640
And how do our systems actually
                support that vision?

00:43.920 --> 00:46.600
So, just a couple of basics
                around systems.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.760
First of all, when I talk about business systems, I
                don't mean just the computer systems, or whatever

00:51.760 --> 00:54.240
is automated in your factory's
                production line.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.520
I'm really talking about your business system as an
                organism, the entire business, which includes

01:00.760 --> 01:05.880
your culture, your leadership style, how things are
                done around here — not just the tasks and tools and

01:05.920 --> 01:07.120
processes that you follow.

01:07.720 --> 01:13.960
All of these things, ultimately, might result in,
                what we might call a computerised system, or an

01:14.000 --> 01:16.240
automated system, or a factory's
                production line.

01:17.120 --> 01:23.680
And just bear in mind that a computer system is a subset
                of your entire business system as an organism itself.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.320
So, when we talk about business systems, I want you
                to bear in mind that there are, really, two basic

01:29.320 --> 01:30.800
models that we're working with.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.720
One type is the linear process model, which
                is really your input, throughput, output.

01:35.960 --> 01:42.120
And within each step, or each task, in a long
                process, you might have a series of tasks.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.520
Each task itself can be broken down
                into input, throughput, output.

01:46.840 --> 01:52.040
Remember the concept of holons and each system being
                a holarchy containing its own sub-systems as

01:52.040 --> 01:52.400
well?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.800
It's really just that: input,
                throughput, output.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.720
The other type of basic system can be modelled as a
                circular system where, really, it's an infinite

02:00.720 --> 02:01.080
flow.

02:01.160 --> 02:06.440
It just keeps on repeating on itself, and you have
                positive feedback where the system reinforces

02:06.440 --> 02:10.720
itself, or there's negative feedback which
                involves the system balancing itself.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.600
If you think of the human
                body and homeostasis.

02:13.640 --> 02:18.040
In other words, maintaining your temperature, or
                maintaining your energy levels, maintaining

02:18.040 --> 02:20.640
your hydration levels in your body.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.040
That's a concept of homeostasis where the system
                relies on negative feedback to ensure that you

02:26.040 --> 02:29.360
maintain the right temperature for,
                you know, healthy survival.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.640
And business systems operate
                in much the same way.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.440
Obviously, there will be exogenous or
                external factors that cause changes.

02:37.480 --> 02:41.160
If you're in a cold room, your body is going to
                want to shiver to increase the temperature.

02:41.840 --> 02:47.920
When a business hits an economic slump, your business
                needs to shiver and do something to activate

02:47.960 --> 02:55.200
its markets and, you know, generate more leads, or
                exploit the customers that it has by having them

02:55.240 --> 02:58.640
increase their basket size, or spend more
                money over their lifetime with you.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.800
So, those are ways that your business tries to
                maintain its own homeostasis as an organism.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.240
So, I want to tell you about a story with
                one of my clients several years ago.

03:09.200 --> 03:16.440
She was the owner of a business where they provided
                a service in the interior décor and, sort of, furniture market.

03:16.520 --> 03:21.360
But, essentially, the business was in a situation
                where they had an overcapacity.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.720
It was very soon after the
                2008 economic crisis.

03:25.280 --> 03:31.560
And they had an overcapacity where their demand for
                their services had dropped down a little bit, and

03:31.600 --> 03:36.320
she was in a situation where they were having their
                staff work half-days, you know, they were working

03:36.320 --> 03:36.960
short-time.

03:37.240 --> 03:42.040
She was laying off a couple of people, but she still
                had the infrastructure, the factory, where the

03:42.040 --> 03:44.600
factory was underutilised and
                staff were underutilised.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.720
Revenue had, obviously, dropped down because
                of the general market conditions.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.120
So, the business's objective, the vision was: How do
                we exploit the capacity and the infrastructure

03:56.120 --> 03:56.800
that we have?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.720
And how do we look after our people?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.800
You know, we're not downsizing
                or anything like that.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.880
How do we turn that around
                and grow revenues?

04:04.560 --> 04:10.200
And in the conversation, in the coaching conversation,
                many of the things that we spoke about; we

04:10.240 --> 04:15.760
assessed their feasibility, you know, high-level options,
                until we got to one point where I asked

04:15.760 --> 04:18.000
her about her sales pipeline.

04:18.240 --> 04:23.280
How does she manage from when a lead
                is generated to the point of sale?

04:23.640 --> 04:24.720
How do they manage that?

04:25.000 --> 04:29.080
And I took a systems analysis approach to that
                and asked, "Okay, what are the steps?"

04:29.120 --> 04:35.400
So, these are the two entry points for a lead that's
                been generated: either the customer phones in, or

04:35.440 --> 04:38.120
it's a walk-in customer they — literally
                walk into the showroom.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.360
What happens next is, there's a
                needs analysis that's done.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.760
This is your next stage in
                the quoting process.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.360
The sales assistant will ask a couple of questions,
                the customer will say it's this kind of

04:48.360 --> 04:53.000
environment, this is a kind of feel that they want in
                their home environment, and next step after that

04:53.000 --> 04:54.360
is, "Well, here are the options."

04:54.840 --> 05:00.040
Customer considers a couple of options, picks one,
                picks two, or configures the solution in a

05:00.080 --> 05:02.920
certain way and that, then,
                turns into a quote.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.640
And then I asked my client in the coaching
                session, "So, what happens next?"

05:07.080 --> 05:11.560
And the next step was, well, the customer will come
                back and say, "This is your order number," or, "I

05:11.560 --> 05:14.680
phoned in two weeks ago and asked
                about this, you quoted me, sir."

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
You know, this kind of thing.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.640
"This is the price.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.320
Can you do it?"

05:17.760 --> 05:19.400
And that was their system.

05:19.880 --> 05:23.520
So, immediately I realised, well, maybe
                there's a gap in the system.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.080
Perhaps what they could do is follow up.

05:26.440 --> 05:31.240
And maybe have, say, after a week, after two weeks,
                after some sort of time frame, go back into their

05:31.240 --> 05:36.640
quote book and see all the old quotes that have not
                been accepted yet and turned into orders that have

05:36.680 --> 05:40.880
been placed; can they follow up more actively
                and be proactive with those customers?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.080
She did exactly that.

05:42.120 --> 05:48.640
She instituted another step in her process where they
                would go, on a weekly or daily basis, they would

05:48.680 --> 05:52.160
go into their quote book and look up
                all the old unaccepted quotes.

05:52.240 --> 05:56.600
Anything that was older than two weeks, that which
                had not been accepted yet, they actually phoned

05:56.640 --> 05:57.320
that customer.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.280
And two things came out of this.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.240
First of all, they got a lot more precise about the
                data they were capturing from each customer, but

06:04.240 --> 06:10.520
the big benefit was, after about three months, in
                a follow-up coaching session, my customer- my

06:10.560 --> 06:14.800
client said in the coaching conversation that, actually,
                what happened, and this is what, this was

06:14.800 --> 06:20.120
their business objective — to grow revenue — 
                they had increased revenue by 50%.

06:20.920 --> 06:26.000
Such a simple change made such a big difference
                in achieving the business objective.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.040
You know, from the initial coaching conversation
                of, "Hey, I need a coach.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.760
Can you help me save the business?

06:31.840 --> 06:37.800
I want to save the business from shutting down and
                having to fire people and, you know, losing my livelihood."

06:38.440 --> 06:43.000
We turned that business around and it was, you know,
                one of my favourite success stories from a

06:43.040 --> 06:48.720
coaching-success point of view, but from a business
                systems point of view, can you see how a simple

06:48.760 --> 06:50.600
tweak made such a big difference?

06:50.640 --> 06:55.040
And, literally, it took them five minutes to just go
                through that quote book and pick out all the old

06:55.080 --> 06:58.120
orders, phone those customers,
                and see what happens.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.480
So, just a quick recap.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.760
The basic principles are; you need to understand,
                first of all, what the business objectives are.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.560
You have to have a clear picture of
                what is the business objective.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.480
What's your vision?

07:09.520 --> 07:11.560
Break that down into, maybe,
                sub-objectives.

07:11.920 --> 07:16.040
You cannot start a project without assessing what your
                various options are, in relation to where you

07:16.080 --> 07:17.600
are now and where you want to be.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.640
Then, when you sit your business- Sorry, your project
                objective, whatever the system needs to be

07:23.240 --> 07:26.440
doing for the business, be clear
                about the system's function.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.920
That, then, drives your
                project objective.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.840
When you start your project, be clear that the
                project is not going to satisfy the business objective.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.320
Your project is going to build a system, implement
                that system, and that's the project objective.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.880
When that project is signed off, that's when you've
                handed over your system, and it's now the

07:42.880 --> 07:48.440
business owner or the systems owner's responsibility
                to exploit that system in order to achieve

07:48.480 --> 07:49.400
the business objective.

07:49.960 --> 07:55.560
So, the project doesn't achieve the business objective;
                the project's deliverable achieves the business objective.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.360
Be clear on that.

07:56.960 --> 07:57.680
If you're clear on those things,

07:57.680 --> 08:02.360
then you can have a good approach to assessing
                the degree to which your business systems

08:02.760 --> 08:07.560
currently serve your business objective and what your
                new business systems, or changes, need to do

08:07.600 --> 08:09.120
to support the business objectives.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.600
It's all about your systems.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.600
Let's talk on the forum.
